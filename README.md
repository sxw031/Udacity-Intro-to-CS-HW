Udacity cs101, intro to CS. This repository includes all the optional problem sets and two final project - web crawler and the social game network.

## Content

* "lesson 1 - lesson 7" - the problem sets I think is worth to share after each lecture from the courses

* gamernetwork.py - The Gaming Social Network project built with python scripts

## How to use the lesson 1 - lesson 7
I have summarized the lecture contain as my study notes as well as the notes to share to those who need it. The detail learning processes are inculded in my blog at here: https://wang-shijie.ghost.io/tag/code/#open. I hope you will find pleasant in coding python just like I do, but if you don't it is still worth sharing.

## Project Descriptions

* **Web Crawler Project:** For SEOs, the web crawler is a powerful tool. This is the web-crawler search engine built in the inaugural cs101 class at Udacity, and augemented into a simple application to run on your local machine. I Used index data structure to repond a query when someone wants the given web pages that correspond to the given keyword.


* **Gamer Social Network:** Assume You and your friend have decided to start a company that hosts a gaming social network site. Your friend will handle the website creation (they know what they are doing, having taken our web development class). However, it is up to you to create a data structure that manages the game-network information and to define several procedures that operate on the network. This project is aimed to implement this task.
